This document was produced while taking the Spring 2016, University of Toronto Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Techniques (aka Microwave Circuits) course (ECE1236H), taught by Prof.\ G. V. Eleftheriades.

\paragraph{Course Syllabus}

This course outlines the principles of designing modern microwave and RF circuits.

\begin{itemize}
\item Signal-integrity issues in high-speed digital circuits.
\item The wave equation.
\item Ideal transmission lines.
\item Transients on transmission-lines.
\item Planar transmission lines and introduction to MMIC's.
\item Designing with scattering parameters.
\item Planar power dividers.
\item Directional couplers.
\item Microwave filters.
\item Solid-state microwave amplifiers.
\item Noise.
\item Diode-mixers.
\item RF receiver chains.
\item Oscillators.
\end{itemize}

The text for this course was \citep{pozar2009microwave}.  It was not a required text, and the course was taught off of slides.
